Dear [Recipient's Name / Team],

I hope you're doing well.

We would like to highlight a critical blocker affecting 39 items in our processing pipeline. The issue stems from current limitations in the Runbook APIs, specifically:

The APIs do not support synchronous processing.

There is no response payload provided, making it impossible for downstream systems to reliably proceed.

In addition, we are still awaiting alignment on the expected message structure, which is essential for us to implement the necessary changes on our end. Until this structure is finalized and agreed upon, we are unable to proceed with amending our processing logic.

We kindly request:

Clarity and confirmation on the expected message format.

A timeline or ETA for when this agreement and corresponding API enhancements will be available.

Resolving this will help unblock the 39 impacted items and avoid further downstream delays.

Please let us know if a working session would help move this forward more quickly.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Role]
[Your Team/Org]
