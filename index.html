Subject: 🚨 Urgent: API Testing & Sign-Off Required by July 31 – Enhanced Change Control in IT Service Portal

Dear [Stakeholder Name / Team],

As part of the ongoing enhancements to the Change Control process within the IT Service Portal, we have introduced critical updates that directly impact APIs associated with your domain functionalities.

To ensure a smooth transition and prevent downstream disruptions, your team’s testing and formal sign-off are essential.

🔍 What Needs to Be Done:
Validate your domain’s APIs using the IT Service Portal, integrated with the new change control features.

Confirm all workflows, access controls, and approval behaviors function as expected.

Provide a sign-off confirming successful testing completion.

🕒 Deadline: July 31, 2025
This date is a hard cut-off to meet release and compliance timelines. Missing this deadline may result in:

Delay in the rollout of change control enhancements

Operational or integration issues during deployment

Escalation to senior leadership due to compliance impact

✅ Next Steps:
Assign a point of contact to complete testing

Use the portal’s staging environment to verify functionality

Submit sign-off via [link to form, email, or portal workflow]

If you’ve already started testing—thank you. If not, we request that your team prioritizes this immediately to avoid risk of delay.

Please confirm your acknowledgment of this message and share an ETA for testing completion at your earliest.

Let us know if you need support from the portal team to expedite this process.

Thank you for your attention and partnership.

Best regards,
